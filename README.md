## Introduction

App is a modern web application built to showcase the integration of Redux Toolkit and React. This project serves as a practical example for managing state in a React application using Redux, handling API interactions with Redux Toolkit's RTK Query, and utilizing TypeScript for type safety. It also demonstrates the use of hooks like useDispatch and useSelector to interact with the Redux store, and includes practical examples of handling CRUD operations in a RESTful API context.

## Features

- **State Management with Redux Toolkit:** Centralized and simplified state management using Redux Toolkit to make the Redux development experience more intuitive.
- **RTK Query for API Requests:** Efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the Redux store using RTK Query.
- **Hooks Integration:** Seamless interaction with the Redux store in functional components using `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks.
- **TypeScript Support:** Enhanced code reliability and developer experience with TypeScript, ensuring type safety across the application.
- **CRUD Operations:** Full demonstration of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, showing how to manage data effectively in a React-Redux environment.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/redux-toolkit-basics.git
cd redux-toolkit-basics
npm install
```

## Usage

After completing the installation, you can start the project locally using:

```bash
npm run dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173.
```

## Concepts Covered

- Reducers: Functions responsible for handling state transitions based on dispatched actions, with examples of handling arrays and objects in the Redux state.
- Actions: Plain objects or async functions (with Thunks) that describe changes in the state and handle side effects like API calls.
- useDispatch/useSelector: React hooks for dispatching actions and selecting parts of the state from the Redux store in functional components.
- CombineReducers: Utility to merge multiple reducer functions into a single root reducer, enabling modular and maintainable state management.
- RTK Query: Powerful data-fetching and caching mechanism integrated into Redux Toolkit, simplifying API interactions and state synchronization.
- TypeScript Integration: Use of TypeScript to provide strong typing, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability.
